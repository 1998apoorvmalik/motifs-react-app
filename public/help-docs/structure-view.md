## Structure View Page

The **Structure View Page** allows you to explore the complete RNA secondary structure of a selected molecule that contains undesignable motifs.


### Features

- **Full RNA Visualization**: An SVG diagram shows the full secondary structure with clearly marked base pairs and loops.
- **Highlighted Motifs**: Undesignable motifs found in the structure are highlighted directly in the diagram for easy identification.
- **Interactive Zoom & Pan**: You can zoom and pan within the SVG to closely inspect any region of the structure.


### Structure Details

Each structure page includes:

- **Structure ID** – A unique identifier for the RNA structure  
- **Sequence** – The full RNA sequence (visible and downloadable)  
- **Dot-Bracket Notation** – A compact representation of the structure’s base pairings  
- **Length** – Total number of nucleotides  
- **Base Pair Stats** – Total pairs, unpaired regions, and loop summaries  
- **Motif List** – All undesignable motifs detected in the structure, with clickable links to view their individual detail pages


### Navigation

- Clicking on any **motif** in the list or diagram will take you to its **Motif Detail Page**
- Use browser navigation or header links to return to the Motif View Page or explore other sections of the help documentation
