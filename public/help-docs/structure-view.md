## Structure View Page

The **Structure View Page** allows you to browse RNA secondary structures that contain one or more undesignable motifs.

![All Structures Page](/motifserver/help-docs/figs/all-structures-page.png)

### Overview

This page serves as an entry point to explore undesignable RNA structures. Each listed structure is known to contain at least one minimal undesignable motif.

You can:

- **Browse all structures** with undesignable motifs
- **Search** structures by ID
- **Filter by RNA family** to focus on specific types of RNA
- **Sort structures** by properties like length, number of loops, or motif count
- **Expand a structure** to view a detailed visualization and analysis

### Each Structure Includes:

- **Structure ID** – Unique identifier for the RNA structure
- **Unique Motif Count** – Number of unique undesignable motifs present in the structure
- **RNA Family** – Family classification (e.g., 16S, tmRNA, eterna, etc.)
- **Length** – Number of nucleotides in the structure
- **Number of Base Pairs** – Total base pairs in the structure
- **Number of Loops** – Total loops in the structure
- **SVG Preview** – Visual representation of the structure
- **Dot-Bracket Notation** – Textual representation of the secondary structure in dot-bracket format

### Viewing Structure Details

Clicking on any structure opens its **detailed view**, which includes:

- **Interactive SVG Visualization** of the full RNA secondary structure  
  - Highlighted regions where undesignable motifs occur  
  - Ability to zoom, pan, and explore the structure visually  
- Detailed statistics of the structure (as described above).
- **List of Motifs Present**  
  - Each motif links to its dedicated **Motif Detail Page**  
  - Motif locations are indicated on the structure diagram

Clicking on **View Motif** from any motif entry in this page opens the **Motif Detail Page**, where you can explore all details about that motif, including its occurrences across different structures.
