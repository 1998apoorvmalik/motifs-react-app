## Motif View Page

The **Motif View Page** allows you to browse and explore all undesignable RNA motifs identified by the system. It provides two viewing modes and tools to help you quickly find and inspect motifs of interest.


### Viewing Modes

- **Grid View**: Motifs are displayed as compact visual cards showing a quick snapshot of each motif’s structure and statistics.
- **List View**: A tabular format for easier comparison across motifs. Columns are sortable by properties like occurrence count or length.


### Each Motif Includes:

- **Motif ID** – Unique identifier  
- **Occurrences** – Number of times the motif appears across all RNA families  
- **Length** – Number of nucleotides in the motif  
- **Boundary Pairs** – Number of base pairs at the motif's ends  
- **Internal Pairs** – Number of base pairs entirely within the motif  
- **Loops** – Number of loops in the motif 
- **RNA Families** – Family count and their distribution  
- **SVG Preview** – Visual structure representation of the motif


### Search and Filter

At the top of the page, you’ll find a **search bar** and **filter options**:

- Search by **motif ID** or any keyword appearing in the properties
- Filter by:
  - Motif length
  - Number of base pairs
  - Family count
  - Number of loops

These tools make it easy to narrow down the list and focus on motifs that meet your criteria.


### Viewing Motif Details

Clicking on any motif opens a **Motif Detail Page**, which includes:

- A larger SVG rendering of the motif structure
- A list of all structures where the motif appears
- Detailed statistics like pairing breakdown and loop types
- Family occurrence data

Clicking on a **Structure ID** from this page leads to the **Structure View Page**, where you can explore the full RNA secondary structure containing that motif.
