## Input New Structure

This tool allows you to input a new **RNA secondary structure** (in dot-bracket notation) and check whether it contains any **undesignable motifs**.

### What It Does

- Accepts a **dot-bracket secondary structure** as input.
- Searches for **undesignable motifs** within the structure.
- Determines whether the structure is **designable or undesignable** based on motif presence.

### How to Use

1. Paste your RNA secondary structure (in dot-bracket format) into the input box.
2. Click **“Submit”**.
3. The tool analyzes the structure and finds any undesignable motifs.

### Output

- If any **undesigned motifs** are found:
  - The structure is marked **undesignable**.
  - A list of matched motifs is displayed, each with a link to its detailed view.

- If **no undesigned motifs** are found:
  - The structure is considered **designable** under current knowledge.

### Notes

- Only dot-bracket structures are required; the sequence is not needed.
